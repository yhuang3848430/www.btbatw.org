            The Boston Taiwanese Biotechnology Association (BTBA) was founded in 2012 by a group of Taiwanese graduate students, postdocs and young professionals in the greater Boston area. Our goals are to enhance scientific collaboration, foster individual career development, facilitate interactions, and strengthen networking among academic and industrial bioscience communities in Taiwan and the U.S. We host annual symposia that attract over 350 young Taiwanese professionals from biology-related fields across the United States.
